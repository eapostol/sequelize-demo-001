# Sequelize Demo 001
A Simple Demo for Node, Express (4), mySQL2, Sequelize and body-parser

The _master_ branch contains just the base dependencies, this README, and a .gitignore.

Subsequent Branches represent successive builds of the example. Explore those branches to see this app evolves.

Installed NPM packages:

- "body-parser": "^1.18.3"
- "express": "^4.16.3",
- "mysql2": "^1.6.1",
- "sequelize": "^4.38.0"

**body**-**parser** extracts the entire **body** portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on req. **body** . The middleware was a part of Express.js earlier but now is installed separately. This module parses the JSON, buffer, string and URL encoded data submitted using HTTP POST request.

The **MySQL2 project** is a continuation of [MySQL-Native](https://github.com/sidorares/nodejs-mysql-native). Protocol parser code was rewritten from scratch and api changed to match popular [mysqljs/mysql](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql). MySQL2 team is working together with [mysqljs/mysql](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql) team to factor out shared code and move it under [mysqljs](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql) organisation

**Sequelize** is a promise-based ORM for Node.js v4 and up. It supports the dialects PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite and MSSQL and features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.
